		<h1>How to do the Mafia</h1>
		<p>
		<h3 style="padding-left:5px"><u>Objective</u></h3>
			<p style = "padding-left: 10px">Work together to kill off all the Mafia or get killed by them. The game ends when either the Mafia is killed or the Mafia kills everybody else.</p>
		<h3 style="padding-left:5px"><u>Player Types</u></h3>
			<ol style="padding-top:5px" type="1">
				<li style="margin-left: 10px; padding-bottom:4px"><b>Moderator:</b> The narrator/referee who runs the game. He/she must make sure the game runs smooth, take votes, and narrate who dies (generally the person who knows the rules best)</li>
					<li style="margin-left: 10px; padding-bottom:4px"><b>Mafia:</b> in-game faction who can kill a single person of choice at night. During the first night, they only take note of the other members of the Mafia. The number of Mafia members is equal to 1/3 of the amount of players</li>
					<li style="margin-left: 10px; padding-bottom:4px"><b>Villagers:</b> Innocent bystanders who can only vote on people to lynch</li>
					<li style="margin-left: 10px; padding-bottom:4px"><b>Doctor:</b> Player (preferably with a PhD) who can choose one person to save each night (meaning that person will not die if chosen by Mafia/Vigilante)</li>
					<li style="margin-left: 10px; padding-bottom:4px"><b>Cop:</b> This Play may inspect one person per night and find out whether they are Mafia or not</li>
					<li style="margin-left: 10px"><b>Vigilante:</b> Every night this player, like the Mafia, has the ability to kill off one person of choice</li>
			</ol>
			<b style = "padding-left: 10px">Note:</b> these special abilities are used only during <i>night</i>!
			
		<h3 style="padding-top:5px"><u>Start of the game</u></h3>
			<p style = "padding-left: 10px"> Each player is given a role at random except the chosen Moderator. Each person may only look at the role randomly given to him/her. There are two cycles in the game, night and day, starting with night.</p>
				<li style="padding-top:5px; margin-left: 30px"><b>Night:</b> Each night, all players must keep their heads down and eyes closed unless told otherwise by Moderator. Once the Moderator finishes directing each special role, the day cycle starts again.</li>
					<li style="padding-top:3px; margin-left: 60px"><b>Moderator:</b> One group at a time, you tell each a special player (ex: Mafia, Cop) to lift their head(s) until they pick a person to perform their action. Repeat the process for each other special player</li>
				<li style="padding-top:5px; margin-left: 30px"><b>Day:</b> All players have 5 minutes to discuss who to kill. Everybody may nominate to kill another. If so the person nominated may have a chance to defend themselves. If a second player agrees/seconds the nomination, then everybody must vote to execute the person or not. If the 5 minute timer runs out, the cycle ends and it is night.</li>
					<li style="padding-top:3px; margin-left: 60px"><b>Voting:</b> Each player puts their head down and when the moderator says so, puts their thumb up or down in agreement or disagreement respectively. <i>MAJORITY WINS, Equal votes means the person lives!</i></li>
